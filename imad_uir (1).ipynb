      "Answer: Based on your food spending over the last 365 days, you've spent a total of $180.00 across 3 expenses, averaging $60.00 per expense. Your highest single expense was $150.00 (caramelos), and the lowest was $10.00 (botellas de agua). While this doesn't seem excessive, it's important to consider your overall budget and financial goals. If you'd like, I can help you set a budget limit for food and monitor your spending against it.\n",
